## About Me
===I practice writing websites using React, making my code more accessible and understandable, studying third-party libraries for more functionality and animation of elements on the page. I get involved in work that gives me a lot of pleasure. I am able and willing to work on results.
In my free time I like to play sports, read or watch interesting movies and take interest in economics.===
